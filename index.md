## CAREER OBJECTIVE

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/vaibhav2620/Vaibhav-Mistry-/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### EDUCATION 

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>semester</td>
    <td>year of passing</td>
    <td>marks obtained</td>
    <td>percentage</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vaibhav2620/Vaibhav-Mistry-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
